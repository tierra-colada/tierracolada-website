Modern data processing and visualization technologies require flexible solutions that work across all operating systems. Cross-platform software with 2D/3D graphics, VR/AR support and machine learning tools accelerates prototyping of new interpretation methods and implementation of R&D developments into production workflows.

These solutions enable:

- ðŸ”¹ Seismic data viewing and analysis
- ðŸ”¹ Geological and hydrodynamic model editing in unified environment
- ðŸ”¹ Testing new processing algorithms regardless of OS
- ðŸ”¹ Immersive analysis in VR/AR environments

Integration with Python/Jupyter simplifies adoption of experimental methodologies.

**Benefits for R&D teams**

- ðŸ”¹ Rapid transition from concept to working prototype
- ðŸ”¹ Compatibility with research libraries (NumPy, TensorFlow)
- ðŸ”¹ Intermediate results visualization in 2D/3D/AR formats
