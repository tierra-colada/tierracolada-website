Cutting-edge seismic data processing algorithms deliver detailed subsurface visualization with unprecedented accuracy. The combined application of seismic tomography, full waveform inversion (FWI), reverse time migration (RTM), and least squares RTM (LSRTM) enables high-quality 2D and 3D imaging of geological structures.

Key advantages:

- ðŸ”¹ Upper layer velocity model building
- ðŸ”¹ Velocity model refinement in complex geological environments
- ðŸ”¹ Clear imaging of steeply dipping faults, gas hydrates, and thin-bed reservoirs
- ðŸ”¹ Artifact reduction in low signal-to-noise ratio zones

**Technology Stack**

- ðŸ”¹ Tomography: upper layer velocity model building
- ðŸ”¹ FWI: full-waveform inversion for accurate velocity models
- ðŸ”¹ RTM: depth imaging with preserved wavefield kinematics
- ðŸ”¹ LSRTM: amplitude-accurate results for quantitative interpretation
