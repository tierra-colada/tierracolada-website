The use of intelligent algorithms significantly enhances the efficiency and safety of key operations in the oil and gas industry. Machine learning enables prediction of abnormally high formation pressures from seismic data, minimizes risks of drilling fluid losses through analysis of historical data and geomechanical models, and optimizes injection well parameters for reservoir pressure maintenance.

ML models uncover hidden data patterns difficult to detect with conventional methods. Solutions enable:

- ðŸ”¹ Predicting drilling complications through integrated analysis of seismic, logging and operational parameters
- ðŸ”¹ Overpressure zone forecasting with optimal mud weight recommendations
- ðŸ”¹ Automated fluid loss monitoring and real-time drilling fluid optimization
- ðŸ”¹ Calculation of ideal injection volumes for pressure maintenance
- ðŸ”¹ Real-time anomaly detection

Integration via web interfaces ensures smooth implementation into existing workflows without major IT infrastructure changes.
