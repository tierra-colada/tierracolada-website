## Powerful Tool for Data Analysis, Visualization and Interpretation

**Colada** is a flexible and extensible platform designed for professionals in geology, geophysics and engineering. It combines high-performance computing (FWI/RTM) with modern virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) technologies, providing complete control over data and processes.

## Technological Foundation

- 🔹 C++ core - maximum performance
- 🔹 Full Python integration - all functionality accessible via Python scripts
- 🔹 Cross-platform - works on Windows, Linux, macOS

## Data Visualization

- 🔹 2D/3D graphics with VR/AR and holographic display support
- 🔹 Data synchronization and projection for team collaboration
- 🔹 3D printing support - creation of physical geological structure models

## Flexibility and Extensibility

- 🔹 Modular architecture - add new features through C++ or Python
- 🔹 Built-in Python interpreter - work directly or via Jupyter Notebook
- 🔹 GUI designer - rapid interface creation without deep programming knowledge

## Who is Colada For?

- 1️⃣ **Geophysicists** - pre/post-stack data visualization
- 2️⃣ **Geologists** - 3D reservoir model visualization and editing
- 3️⃣ **Research teams** - R&D solution prototyping and implementation
